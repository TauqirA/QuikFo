# QuikFo (Quick Information) - (Made at VTHack)
Intro: We decided to make this in order to learn how to make a chrome extension
as well using JSON/APIs. 
<p>
  In the search for an idea we found ourselves searching and searching and searching. Then we realized that in searching we had opened many tabs with just search engines in them. We found ourselves distracted within these tabs, eventually becoming lost in the search. </p>
  <p>This inspired us to think of a way to get search results quickly without becoming lost from the task at hand and remaining focused. We expanded on our idea to include the use of a calculator through wolfram|alpha, to include the use of a dictionary through the wordnik api, and to provide a source for all your wiki needs. </p>
 <p> To control the app is simple. Select a word or phrase you want to search and press Ctrl+Shift+A. You can now select more options such as the calculator or wikipedia. You can also type any phrase to into the search box.</p>

How it works:
The popup.html is the file that contains the html design of the app. 
The popup.js holds all JavaScript code due to security reasons set by google.
The css is done using boostrap.

APIs used:
http://developer.wordnik.com/ for definitions

What it does:
Provide a small window for a user to visit many pages without leaving there current page in a fast and seamless way.
