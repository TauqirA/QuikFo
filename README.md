Intro (Skip if uninterested): We decided to make this in order to learn how to make a chrome extension

How it works:
The popup.html is the file that contains the html design of the app. 
The popup.js hold all JavaScript code due to security reasons set by google.
The css is done using boostrap.

APIs used:

What it does:
Provide a small window for a user to visit many pages without leaving there current page in a fast and seamless way.
